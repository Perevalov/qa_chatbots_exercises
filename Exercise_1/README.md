## Context

* Many knowledge bases (KB) are stored using a graph format. 
* You will require at least some basic knowledge in retrieving information from such a knowledge base via SPARQL (additionally, KB-based approaches will be used in the used QA framework). SPARQL is the common query language for querying fact-based KBs.act-based KBs.

## Learning Objectives

Learn to write simple SPARQL queries.

## Task

Depending on your exercise variant manually write SPARQL queries for the corresponding questions.

The variants are available in this GitHub repository. Also, in the repository, you can find the example of the question-SPARQL query pairs.
